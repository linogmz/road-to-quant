This is a personal sets of exercises and projects to get closer to the quant status with a strong emphasis on Fixed Income. 

Road-To-Quant is a beginner friendly and self directed project to learn and showcase different skills necessary to work and collaborate in the quant industry.

Along the way we will use different kinds of programs/techniques while trying to document as much as possible.

This is not a course but a mix of learnings starting from 0, while referring to some interesting resources such as: 
- "The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities" by Frank J. Fabozzi
- The Charted Financial Analyst books (and adjacent resources)
- Few relevant paper from the industry (Thanks to quantstackexchange.com)

Please feel free to collaborate as it is my first time even interacting with the command line and git to share my progress haha. It's really exciting to start this adventure !
